# Patent Term and Relation Detection for Image Data Processing

This project aims to develop an NLP system for detecting terms and relations in patents related to Image Data Processing or Generation. It leverages the power of spaCy, Prodigy, and scispaCy libraries to handle and process patent data efficiently.

# Overview
The project focuses on extracting relevant terms and their relationships from patents in the domain of Image Data Processing or Generation. We also use Prodigy to create an annotation task for term and relation detection. Annotate the documents with relevant terms and their relationships.

# Usage
- First, preprocess the patent documents and convert them into a suitable format for annotation using Prodigy.

- Use Prodigy to create an annotation task for term and relation detection. Annotate the documents with relevant terms and their relationships.

- Train a custom spaCy model using the annotated data. Fine-tune the model for better performance on the Image Data Processing or Generation domain.

- Apply the trained model to new patent documents to automatically extract terms and detect relations.
